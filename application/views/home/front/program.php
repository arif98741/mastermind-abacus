                        <p class="programsp1" >Play School Mastermind believe that early learning goes well beyond childhood. Thereâ€™s an opportunity to do more than just educate the children right now for life. Children at this age are always imbibing information through all their senses. Our guiding principle for the Play Group program is to help your child master the skills needed to succeed in school and in life. At Play School Mastermind kids are more engaged with pre nursery activities like singing, dancing, laughing, playing and exploring indoor and outdoor.</p>
